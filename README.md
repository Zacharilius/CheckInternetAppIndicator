# CheckInternetAppIndicator
An Application Indicator for Ubuntu 14.04

When I lose Internet connection, I find myself compulsively refreshing my
browser to see if the Internet is back online. I created this Ubuntu application
indicator to prevent me having to manually refresh my browser to check for
Internet connection. When the I realize that the I've lost my Internet
connection, I can activate the icon. It checks for Internet connection and then
notifies the me when it successfully connects to the Internet.
